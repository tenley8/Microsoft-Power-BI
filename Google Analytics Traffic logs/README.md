## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Google Analytics Traffic logs metrics. In this scenario, I work with a company that analyze web traffic movements and I have
been asked to analyze the traffic logs metrics. The first metric that I want to analyze is the total web traffic visits, which is the total visit counts
- Next I am going to look at visits over time using a line chart utilizing visit count and date columns.
	- By selecting any month the dispay returns the total visits for that selected month.
	
- Next I will look at the internet traffic bounces, this is when a visitor visits your webpage. We will add the bounces column and then change chart type to line and clustered chart	
	- The resulting chart would indicate the number of bounces of each month selected.
	
- Next Iam going to look at the split between new and returning visitors. The visitor type would be 'New Visitors' Vs 'Returning Visitors'
	- To accomplish this I am going to create a pie chart comparing the visit count to visitor type.
	
- Next I am going to look at our website traffic sources. We are going use a clustered bar chart and for the fields we are going to select the source and visit count columns.
	- The resulting clustered bar chart would return the the visit count by source; source can be Google, Bing... etc.
	- I added a line chart to show the length of time a visitor stays on a website and by the date they visited.
	
- Finally we want to see where our visitors are coming from. We are going to use a filed map chart and the fields are the country and visit count columns.
	- The lighter the color the higher the count with highest visitor count located in the United States.
